# code-refractor-week-1

This project required me to take a pre existing website and fix any problems it may have had, while also organizing the code so that it's easy to find what element on the page the code goes to. The page was mostly done, with the big problem I found with it being that one of the links didn't work, which I was able to quickly fix by adding a proper id tag to it.
